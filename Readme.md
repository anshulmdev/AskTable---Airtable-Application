# Airtable Chatbot App

The Airtable Chatbot App is a custom application built using Airtable Blocks that allows users to interact with their Airtable data using a conversational interface powered by the Claude API.

## Features

- Select a table and view to fetch data from
- Ask questions about the selected data using natural language
- Get responses generated by the Claude API based on the selected data
- Intuitive user interface with icons and styled components
- Error handling and user-friendly dialog boxes for API key validation and messages

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
3. Create a new Airtable base or use an existing one.
4. Copy the app folder to your Airtable base.
5. Configure the app by providing your Claude API key when prompted.

## Usage

1. Open your Airtable base.
2. Navigate to the app by clicking on the app icon in the top-right corner of the base.
3. Select a table and view to fetch data from using the dropdown menus.
4. Click on the "Lock View" button to prepare the data for the chatbot.

## Configuration

The app requires a valid Claude API key to function properly. When you launch the app for the first time or if the API key becomes invalid, a dialog box will appear prompting you to enter your API key. Make sure to provide a valid API key to continue using the app.
